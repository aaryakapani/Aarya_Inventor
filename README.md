# Aarya_Inventor
Intent of this Repo is for Aarya's personal projects

Activating my venv to get ampy to work, which is what is used to connect to the Rapsberry -> source myenv/bin/activate
Help detect your devices -> Desktop % ls /dev/tty.*

Raspberry pi Pico -> /dev/tty.usbmodem2101

Once in the venv, run this while in your python directory -> ampy --port /dev/tty.usbmodem2101 run led.py
